Written Assignment

How-To Guide
The Written Assignment represents 100% of the overall course grade.

Instructions
Develop a Python project to analyse real world scenarios and generate valuable insights
by visualising information. The project aims to analyse data from different data sources,
manipulate information and visualise to generate insights.
You can use any open-source dataset available online for analytics. Each bullet point
for every learning outcome is a milestone to be achieved.
The project should be submitted on the Learn Site under the Assessments section. You
will need to include two files, as described below.
1. Project ZIP File (upload to LMS)
o Code and Data
● Include your entire Python project along with all the code and data
files and upload as part of your submission
● The project should cover all milestones in each learning outcome
to gain full marks (see below)
o Project Report
● A document containing between 1,500 and 2,000 words
● Please use the template provided (see Assessments section to
download)
● The report describes your process, dataset, different sources,
graphs and insights
● Justify the use of each learning outcome concept, for example:
Why did you use list over dictionary?
2. GitHub repository URL
o Create a new repository on GitHub as [UCDPA_yourname]
o Keep committing to the repository
o Remember to include the URL of your repository at the beginning of your
Project Report document
The goal of the assignment is to demonstrate how you are thinking about putting
course concepts and learning into practice to demonstrate the course learning
outcomes:
1. Derive insights into data sources a company can use and how to store that data
2. Outline fundamentals of Python data structures such as lists and arrays and
learn powerful ways to store and manipulate data
3. Identify ways to use Python data structures, execution control statements, and
DataFrames to manipulate data
4. Derive meaningful decisions using Python to compare potential projects and
how to make rational, data-driven decisions
