by visualising information. The project aims to analyse data from different data sources,
manipulate information and visualise to generate insights.

The goal of the assignment is to demonstrate how you are thinking about putting
course concepts and learning into practice to demonstrate the course learning
outcomes:
1. Derive insights into data sources a company can use and how to store that data
2. Outline fundamentals of Python data structures such as lists and arrays and
learn powerful ways to store and manipulate data
3. Identify ways to use Python data structures, execution control statements, and
DataFrames to manipulate data
4. Derive meaningful decisions using Python to compare potential projects and
how to make rational, data-driven decisions
